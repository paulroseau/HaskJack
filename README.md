HaskJack
========

This is a tiny exercise in order to practice writing Haskell code for the first time. My goal is to calculate the expectancy of gains (actually it will be losses :) of a Black Jack player who follows the basic strategy (cf. http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/strategy/4-decks/)
