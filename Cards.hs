-- todo
-- "hit" is just a function which appends a new card to the player's hand
-- "stay" is just returning the player's hand
--
-- a player has a certain amount of money
-- a player is playing with a [(Hand, Amount)], each decision affects either the
-- hand or the amount, it's a list for doubling.
